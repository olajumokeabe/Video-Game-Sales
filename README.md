A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio complement delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback (e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile sensations). Some video games also allow microphone and webcam inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game).

Wii Sports emerges as the top-selling game with an impressive 80 million sales, overshadowing others like Super Mario Bros, Mario Kart Wii, Wii Sports Resort, and more, which all fall within a similar range. Among gaming platforms, PS2 stands out as the leading platform, followed closely by X360, PS3, Wii, DS, and PS. Globally, action, sports, and shooters dominate game sales, with role-playing games following closely. Nintendo holds a strong position as an undefeated game publisher, with Electronic Arts and Activision trailing closely. North America emerges as the primary region for game consumption, surpassing other regions. The peak in game consumption and sales occurred in 2009/2010, followed by a decline the next year, although it's noteworthy that the upward trend began in 1996. This sales pattern is consistent across all regions.
